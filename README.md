# simple-python_calculator

Welcome to your first Python calculator project! The goal is to create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Your task is to implement the code under `simple_python_calculator.py`; we've provided placeholders for the functions. Your job is to write the body of those functions.
*Basic Arithmetic Operations*

- _Add_
 
-_Subtract_

-_Multiply_

- _Divide_ 

We've set up 4 functions here that you need to finish. These are straightforward and should not pose too much trouble. Recall your lessons on basic operators in Python!

*Functions to Implement:*
- `add(num1, num2)`: Returns the sum of `num1` and `num2`.
- `subtract(num1, num2)`: Returns the difference when `num2` is subtracted from `num1`.
- `multiply(num1, num2)`: Returns the product of `num1` and `num2`.
- `divide(num1, num2)`: Returns the result of dividing `num1` by `num2`. If `num2` is 0, return a string warning the user not to divide by 0.

*Exception Handling:*
- In the `divide(num1, num2)` function, ensure that you handle the case where `num2` is 0. Return an appropriate error message like `"Invalid value for denominator, can't divide by 0!"`.
